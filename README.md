# Description
This project involves creating a simulation inspired by Darwin's Theory, where animals interact in an environment. The animals move around a map, consume grass for energy, and engage in reproduction. To survive, animals must eat to increase their energy, and reproduction involves using some of the parent's energy. Animals ultimately die when their energy is depleted.

Each animal possesses a genome, which is a combination of genetic information inherited from its parents. The genome consists of numbers ranging from 0 to 7. Each number correlates with the animal's inclination to move in a specific direction on the map. The frequency of a particular digit in the genome determines the likelihood of the animal moving in the corresponding direction. In essence, the genome influences the animal's movement preferences, contributing to its survival and reproduction in the simulated environment.
